- ### 10 Base-T and 100 Base-T Uses 2pairs
- ### 1000 Base-T and 10G Base-T Uses 4Pairs


# 10 Base-T and 100 Base-T 

_Network Interface card on pc and server transmits data in pins 1 and 2
and interfaces on Switch receives data in pints 1 and 2

- ### Straight - Through cable = _Wire one will connect to pin spot one in both connectors, wire two will connect to pin spot two in both connectors, and so on_

- ### Crossover cable = _Wires are crossed over each other (pin 1 to pin 3 and so on)_

- # Newer networking devices includes a feature called _AUTO MDI-X_ to solve the problem of straight-through cable and crossover cable


- # For  1000Base-T and  10GBase-T Each Pair is bidirectional (each pair isn't dedicated to transmitting or receiving data) thus they operate in faster speed
